                            Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
                            I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
                            Nothing lasts forever
                            But this is gonna take me down
                            
                        
                            He's so tall and handsome as hell
                            He's so bad, but he does it so well
                            I can see the end as it begins
                            My one condition is
                            
                    
                            Say you'll remember me
                            Standin' in a nice dress
                            Starin' at the sunset, babe
                            Red lips and rosy cheeks
                            Say you'll see me again
                            Even if it's just in your
                            Wildest dreams, ah, ha

                        <p class="pfam">I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
                            But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
                            And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
                            And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
                        
                            Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
                            We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
                            Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
                            And I can picture it after all these days
                            
                
                            And I know it's long gone and
                            That magic's not here no more
                            And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
                            Oh, oh, oh

                            And all my single friends are jealous
                            He says everything I need to hear and it's like
                            I couldn't ask for anything better
                            He opens up my door and I get into his car
                            And he says you look beautiful tonight
                            And I feel perfectly fine
                            
            
                            But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
                            And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
                            You're so in love that you act insane
                            And that's the way I loved you
                            Breaking down and coming undone
                            It's a roller coaster kind of rush
                            And I never knew I could feel that much
                            And that's the way I loved you</p>
